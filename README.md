I  built a simple React App to showcase the power of Routing...

Tasks undergone:
1. Setup react-router
2. Implement Nested routes, 404 page, and Error boundary
3. Set up client-side pagination using [RandomUser.me](www.randomuser.me) API in one of your routes called Users 
4. In the Users route, show the prev, next, and navigation to individual pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. 
5. Implement accessibility and disabled state and API loading states.
